# Jimmie Maggard @akitafuki
Hi, I'm Jimmie. I've been taking a break from tech industry to recuperate from all the chaos of the last few years and to spend more time with my doggo Oatmeal. I am always open to the right opportunities.

You can probably find me live on my Twitch in the evening playing some games badly.

## How I work
I am motivated by my curiosity for new shiny things and my desire to know how things work. I prefer some loose structure, and have a tendency to make lists for myself (Trello). I may seem like a grouch if I am in the middle of something, but leave me a message and I will get back to you.

## Currently working on
- Getting my resume site up and running.
- Re-architecting my humble bundle lambda project that I am learning Go on. 

## Currently learning
- Working on AWS Solutions Architect - Associate
- Go language
